                I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who ahd an amazing experience here. I signed up forthe free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and
                most
                grueling-time og my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a
                Software Engineer at a VR startap."</blockquote>

            <blockquote class="main-word__quotes">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written aline of
                code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and stuff
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                totorialcould ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during intrviewsas an exemple of my
                developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</blockquote>
